\section{Further Discussion}
\subsection{Well-Conditionedness}
A common flaw of spectral collocation methods, one could think of them as the highest-order limit of finite difference schemes, is their bad conditioning behaviour.
% TODO: reference

Ideally, we would like the condition number $\kappa(Q)$ to be independent of the order $N$ to which we solve our problem. That means we want
$$\kappa(Q) := \frac{\sigma_{\rm max}(Q)}{\sigma_{\rm min}(Q)} = \frac{\norm{Q}}{\norm{Q^{-1}}} = \mathcal{O}(1)$$
and not $\mathcal{O}(N)$ or even higher orders.

\section{Runtime Analysis}
The following benchmarks were accumulated on an Intel\textregistered \, i7-5600U CPU running at \SI{2.6}{\giga\hertz} as the average over 3 individual runs with different test vectors, consistent across different parameter runs.
