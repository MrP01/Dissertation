\section{Kinetic Theory: The Vlasov Equation}
A very common tool in Plasma physics.
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\cdot {\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {r} }}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\cdot {\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {p} }}=0,$$

This is the collisionless Boltzmann equation.
Vlasov replaces the collision term with long-range interactions.

\section{Vicsek Model}
For the study of active matter (a number of individual agents).

\section{Swarming}
A 2010 paper by \citeauthor{2010-starlings} showed the surprising result that correlation between movement of individual starlings in bird flocks over Rome is scale-free.
In contrast to the assumption that birds only mirror their neighbours' behaviour and swarming behaviour emerges as a result of that, this observation suggests that bird flocks exert collective behaviour beyond local interactions.

  The change in the behavioral state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other animals in the group, no matter how large the group is
  \parencite{2010-starlings}.
\end{quote}
This work was done by individually tracking each starling in the flock and using tracking algorithms to represent their 3 dimensional positions and velocities.
