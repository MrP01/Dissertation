This MMSC thesis with a catchy abstract will explore general kernel spectral methods for finding equilibrium measures where initial progress was made in \cite{2020-power-law-kernels} and \cite{2021-arbitrary-dimensions}.

\paragraph{Statement of Originality:}
The extension of the attractive-repulsive kernel spectral method into a general kernel spectral method along with an implementation of it is original.
All code contributions, starting from the particle simulation software to the implementation of the spectral methods, are entirely original.
We present a lemma for exact calculation of the support radius $R$ when using an $N = 1$ order approximation of the solution and show that it is a unique minimiser.
For larger orders, this result provides a solid initial guess for a subsequent optimisation routine.
