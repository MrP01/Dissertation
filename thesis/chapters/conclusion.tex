\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

Here we summarise the work that has been presented in this dissertation and discuss
possible areas for future work.

\section{Summary}
In the present thesis, we explored the interesting realm of particle-particle interactions.
Next to the written part, the reader will find an implementation of the particle simulator, including a \gls{gui}, as well as the numerical solver.

Give a summary of what has been done. You might do this chapter by chapter but be sure to highlight all the important points.

\section{Future Work}
You don't actually have to list further work, but most people do this so it seems unusual not to. Just think what you would do next if you had more time on this project.

Other approaches, such as the one in \cite{2015-spectral-method-for-boltzmann-equation} show that ...

\section{Conclusion}
You might like to give a final conclusion so the reader is left remembering what you have done, rather than what you would do if there wasn't a submission deadline.
