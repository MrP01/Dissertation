\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In the present thesis, we explored the interesting realm of particle-particle interactions.
Next to the written part, the reader will find an implementation of the particle simulator, including a \gls{gui}, as well as the numerical solver.

Other approaches, such as the one in \cite{2015-spectral-method-for-boltzmann-equation} show that ...
