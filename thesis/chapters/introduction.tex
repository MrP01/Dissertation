This chapter will give a brief overview of the setting of the problem considered in this dissertation, motivate a few biological and physical examples, and set up some notational conventions.

\section{Problem Setting}
The present thesis is concerned with many-body systems, treating particles in an abstract sense as they could take the form of physical atoms, birds in a flock or fish in a school.
Other examples include ant colonies and swarms of insects such as locusts.
A swarm of animals, a set of coordinated entities, brings many advantages for its members.
For example, they share water resistance or it is easier to find a mate within the swarm than otherwise.
They also often mimic larger animals to fend off predators and swarming behaviour (``swarming intelligence'') plays an important role in this process.
There are some disadvantages as well, like the accelerated spread of diseases or when resources are scarce, some swarm species even begin cannibalistic behaviour \parencite{2017-maria-orsogna-swarm-video}.

From a more physical perspective, we have


\section{Notational Conventions}
Let $\N$ denote the natural numbers (positive integers) without $0$ and let $\N_0 := \N \cup \{0\}$.
In the following, we will use \textbf{bold} notation for vectors, matrices will generally be denoted by a capital letter and scalars by a lowercase letter.
We will frequently make use of the (Euclidean) 2-norm of a vector, as denoted by $\norm{\cdot}$.
So for a $d$-dimensional vector $\vec{x} \in \R^d$ we have $\norm{\vec{x}} := \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^d x_k^2}$.

One should also clarify the nature of a few of the integrals appearing in this thesis which are often performed over the closed unit ball $B_1(\vec{x}) := \{\vec{y} \in \R^d \;|\, \norm{\vec{x} - \vec{y}} \le 1\}$ centered at the origin $\vec{x} = \vec{0}$.
These volume integrals (often ended by $\dd^d y$ or $\dd V$) over the $d$-dimensional unit ball shall be written as
$$\int_{B_1(\vec{0})} \dd\vec{y}\,,$$
where $\vec{y} \in \R^d$ is the integration variable.
Note that some definitions of $B_1(\vec{x})$ are open sets, leaving out the shell $\{\vec{y} \in \R^d \;|\, \norm{\vec{x} - \vec{y}} = 1\}$.
The choice of definition does not matter for our purposes as the shell, a hyperplane of Lebesgue measure $0$, does not contribute to the integral.
