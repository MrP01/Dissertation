\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
It doesn't really matter in which order the acknowledgements and abstract come.
In some ways it's nice to put the acknowledgements first then everything that follows is about the project you have done.

% You should generally thank your supervisor(s) in your acknowledgements
% --- not doing so makes quite a statement.
Primarily, I want to thank my supervisors Dr. Timon Gutleb and Prof. Jos√© Carillo for their valuable support in the research and writing process of this dissertation.
I would also like to extend further gratitude to our course director, Dr. Kathryn Gillow, for her never-ending, reliable support to all of us throughout the course.
% If anyone else has helped with the project then thank them too.
I also want to thank my departmental and college supervisors, Prof. Yuji Nakatsukasa and Dr. Jani Bolla for their positive influence and good advice.

% If you have received funding from anywhere, it is standard to thank your funding body.
I would like to thank the Steirische Stipendienstiftung for their generous support which enabled me to pursue this degree in the first place.

It's then up to you who else to thank. You can be brief and stop there, or you can thank family, friends, cohort.
