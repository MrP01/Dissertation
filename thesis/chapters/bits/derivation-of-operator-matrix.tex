Based on the Three-Term Recurrence Relationship (cf. \Cref{def:three-term-recurrence-relationship}).

One can even determine an explicit relationship between the coefficients
in the Jacobi expansion by considering the Jacobi Matrix (cf. \Cref{def:jacobi-matrix}).

Considering the operator $\hat{Q}^\beta[\rho]$ as in \Cref{thm:theorem216}, from the ansatz $\rho(\vec{x})$ (cf. \Cref{def:ansatz}) we have
$$\hat{Q}^{\beta}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{N} \rho_{k} \int_{B_1(\vec{0})} \norm{\vec{x}-\vec{y}}^{\beta} \weight{y}\jacobi{y} \,\dd\vec{y}\,.$$
