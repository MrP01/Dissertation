Based on the {[}{[}Three-Term Recurrence
Relationship{]}{]}.

One can even determine an explicit relationship between the coefficients
in the Jacobi expansion by considering the {[}{[}Jacobi Matrix{]}{]}.

Considering the operator $\hat{Q}^\beta[\rho]$ as in \Cref{thm:theorem216}, from the [[Ansatz]] $\rho(x)$ we have
$$\hat{Q}^{\beta}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{N} \rho_{k} \int \norm{x-y}^{\beta}(1-\norm{y}^2)^{a}P_{k}^{(a, b)}(2\norm{y}^{2}- 1) \,\ddy$$
