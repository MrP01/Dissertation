\section{Comparison with Analytic Solutions}
As introduced in \Cref{sec:analytical-solutions}, there are some analytical solutions available which allow us to perform further analysis of the numerical method in these special cases.

The major advantage of a spectral method is its so-called \textit{spectral convergence}, sometimes also referred to as exponential convergence, cf. \Cref{def:spectral-convergence}.
\input{chapters/bits/spectral-convergence.tex}

For a given set of parameters with a known analytic solution (cf. \Cref{sec:analytical-solutions}), we compare growing orders of the spectral method's solution with the analytic expression in a set of 200 points and plot the pointwise error, cf. \Cref{fig:analytic-solution}.
The figure also shows how the outer optimisation routine will approach the optimal $R_{\rm opt}$ closer and closer for growing orders $N$.

    The analytic solution $\rho(x)$ given in \Cref{eq:analytical-solution-alpha-equal-2} compared to the (spectral method) solutions of different order $N$.
    The ``arches'' occur as a result of the roots of $\rho(x) - \rho_N(x)$, their number approximately equals the order $N$ (a polynomial of degree $N$ has at most $N$ roots).

\end{figure}

The reason for this fast convergence is the choice of weighted basis in \Cref{eq:ansatz} compared to the form of the analytical solution in \Cref{eq:analytical-solution-alpha-equal-2}.
% TODO: when added theorem216() with limit-behaviour
There are more analytic solutions available for other parameter ranges, which we will not analyse within the scope of this dissertation.
