\section{Comparison with Analytic Solutions}
As introduced in \Cref{sec:analytical-solutions}, there are some analytical solutions available which allow us to perform further analysis of the numerical method in these special cases.

  \caption[Comparison with analytical solutions and error]{
    The analytic solution $\rho(x)$ given in \Cref{eq:analytical-solution-alpha-equal-2} compared to the (spectral method) solutions of different order $N$.
    The ``arches'' occur as a result of the roots of $\rho(x) - \rho_N(x)$, their number approximately equals the order $N$ (a polynomial of degree $N$ has at most $N$ roots).

The reason for this fast convergence is the choice of weighted basis in \Cref{eq:ansatz} compared to the form of the analytical solution in \Cref{eq:analytical-solution-alpha-equal-2}.
% TODO: when added theorem216() with limit-behaviour
There are more analytic solutions available for other parameter ranges, which we will not analyse within the scope of this dissertation.
