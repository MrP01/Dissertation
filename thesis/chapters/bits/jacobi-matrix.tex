\begin{remark}{}{jacobi-matrix}
  The Jacobi operator is the matrix \(X \in \R^{N \times N}\) satisfying
  $$x \cdot \vec{P}^{(a,b)}(x) = \vec{P}^{(a,b)}(x) \cdot X^T\,.$$
\end{remark}

The terms in the Jacobi operator are closely connected to the three-term recurrence relationship (cf. \Cref{thm:three-term-recurrence-relationship}), even making the matrix tridiagonal.
