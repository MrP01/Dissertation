@article{2021-carillo-radial,
	abstract = {For the interaction energy with repulsive-attractive potentials, we give generic conditions which guarantee the radial symmetry of the local minimizers in the infinite Wasserstein distance. As a consequence, we obtain the uniqueness of local minimizers in this topology for a class of interaction potentials. We introduce a novel notion of concavity of the interaction potential allowing us to show certain fractal-like behavior of the local minimizers. We provide a family of interaction potentials such that the support of the associated local minimizers has no isolated points and any superlevel set has no interior points.},
