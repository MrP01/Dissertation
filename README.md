Attractive-repulsive equilibrium measure problems appear in the modeling of the continuous limit of
pair-interacting particle systems, e.g. models of animal swarms or classical physical particulates.
From a computing point of view they are a combination of integral equation and minimization problem
– the aim is to find a density u(x) for a given kernel K such that the following energy is minimized.

The project would leverage kernel expansions to construct a general equilibrium measure method on
the unit interval [−1, 1]. The d-dimensional unit ball generalization is then expected to be straightforward
and can be considered as a stretch goal. Comparisons should be made with the corresponding
attractive-repulsive finite particle swarm problems.
